# ChatGPT_Generated_Articles_to_WordPress

Currently being used to auto generate and publish travel articles with images.

Def going to make it do something more intesting when I finish.



## Featured IMG
Word press REST API for python doesnt have the ability to post the IMG as a featured IMG. I use the Auto Featured Image from Title https://wordpress.org/plugins/auto-featured-image-from-title/
All the other plugins are behind a paywall or outdated. Only downside is post needs to be sent to draft then published or published and update for the first HTML img to become a featured IMG.
